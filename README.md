# LD46
My unfinished entry for Ludum Dare 46 (Theme: "Keep it alive")

Game title: ?

My original idea (a dungeon-crawler/tower defense game) failed to come together, so "Plan B" was to make a game where fans inside a stadium have to keep a beach ball in the air. That didn't work out either. Among other reasons, I spent too long trying to make a pseudo-3D effect where the ball appears to go up toward the the top-down camera (along the non-existent Z-axis, since it is a 2D game).

This is "Plan C": a reduced form of the stadium idea that is essentially an unfinished/buggy Pong-like beach volleyball simulator (not quite a game). Nonetheless, this project was a good learning experience for me, being new to game jams and all of these development tools.
